<p>hello! i was bored one day and i decided to make a blog for the site.</p>
<p>it uses the github api to read markdown files in /blogs and render them.</p>
<p>i'm no writer so don't expect the craziest things or frequent blogs.</p>
<hr>
<p>here's a random little image i found on unsplash.com to see if imgs work:</p>
<h1>IMG REMOVED CUS IT DOESNT FIT</h1>
