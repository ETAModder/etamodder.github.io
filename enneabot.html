                    <li><strong>pentagon</strong>: A pentagon is a polygon with five sides. Regular pentagons have equal sides and angles and appear in many natural and artistic designs. They are closely linked to the golden ratio.</li>
                    <li><strong>hexagon</strong>: A hexagon is a six-sided polygon. Regular hexagons tile the plane perfectly without gaps. They commonly appear in crystals and honeycombs.</li>
                    <li><strong>heptagon</strong>: A heptagon is a seven-sided polygon. Regular heptagons cannot be constructed exactly with a compass and straightedge. They are relatively rare in practical design.</li>
                    <li><strong>octagon</strong>: An octagon is an eight-sided polygon. Regular octagons appear in stop signs and architecture. They combine near-circular shape with flat edges.</li>
                    <li><strong>enneagon</strong>: An enneagon is a polygon with nine sides. Regular enneagons have rotational symmetry of order nine. They are also called nonagons.</li>
                    <li><strong>decagon</strong>: A decagon is a ten-sided polygon. Regular decagons are closely related to pentagons and the golden ratio. They have ten equal angles and sides.</li>
                    <li><strong>dodecagon</strong>: A dodecagon is a polygon with twelve sides. Regular dodecagons tile the plane with triangles and squares. They are often used in tiling patterns.</li>
                  
                    <li><strong>pentagram</strong>: A pentagram is a five-pointed star polygon formed from a regular pentagon. It has intersecting diagonals that create smaller pentagons inside. The shape is strongly associated with the golden ratio.</li>
                    <li><strong>hexagram</strong>: A hexagram is a six-pointed star formed by overlapping two equilateral triangles. It is not a single continuous star polygon but a compound figure. It has strong symmetry and cultural significance.</li>
                    <li><strong>heptagram</strong>: A heptagram is a seven-pointed star polygon. It can be constructed in multiple forms depending on how vertices are connected. Heptagrams have complex internal intersections.</li>
                    <li><strong>octagram</strong>: An octagram is an eight-pointed star polygon or compound star. It can be formed by overlapping squares or by step connections on an octagon. Octagrams often appear in decorative art.</li>
                    <li><strong>enneagram</strong>: An enneagram is a nine-pointed star polygon. It is typically drawn by connecting every second or fourth vertex of a nonagon. The shape has both geometric and symbolic interpretations.</li>
                    <li><strong>decagram</strong>: A decagram is a ten-pointed star polygon. It can be constructed in different step patterns producing distinct shapes. Decagrams are related to pentagrams through symmetry.</li>
                    <li><strong>hendecagram</strong>: An eleven-pointed star polygon formed by connecting vertices of a hendecagon at fixed intervals. These shapes are mostly studied in abstract geometry.</li>

                    <li><strong>hendecagon</strong>: A polygon with eleven sides. Regular hendecagons cannot be constructed exactly using classical tools. They are mainly studied in theoretical geometry.</li>
                    <li><strong>icosagon</strong>: A polygon with twenty sides. Regular icosagons closely approximate a circle. They appear in advanced tiling and symmetry studies.</li>
                    <li><strong>triacontagon</strong>: A polygon with thirty sides. It has very fine angular resolution when regular. It is often used as an approximation of circular shapes.</li>
                    <li><strong>tetradecagon</strong>: A polygon with fourteen sides. Regular tetradecagons combine properties of heptagons and symmetry doubling. They appear in decorative tilings.</li>
                    <li><strong>pentadecagon</strong>: A polygon with fifteen sides. Regular pentadecagons relate closely to triangles and pentagons. They are constructible with compass and straightedge.</li>

                    <li><strong>heptagram{7/2}</strong>: The {7/2} heptagram connects every second vertex of a heptagon. It forms a sharp, continuous seven-pointed star.</li>
                    <li><strong>heptagram{7/3}</strong>: The {7/3} heptagram connects every third vertex of a heptagon. It creates a denser internal structure than {7/2}.</li>
                    <li><strong>enneagram{9/2}</strong>: The {9/2} enneagram is formed by skipping one vertex on a nonagon. It creates a smooth nine-pointed star.</li>
                    <li><strong>enneagram{9/4}</strong>: The {9/4} enneagram skips three vertices per step. It produces a much denser star with multiple intersections.</li>
